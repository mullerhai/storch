/** A `torch.layout` is an object that represents the memory layout of a torch.Tensor.
  *
  * Currently, we support ``torch.strided`` (dense Tensors) and have beta support for
  * ``torch.sparse_coo`` (sparse COO Tensors).
  *
  * torch.strided represents dense Tensors and is the memory layout that is most commonly used. Each
  * strided tensor has an associated torch.Storage, which holds its data. These tensors provide
  * multi-dimensional, strided view of a storage. Strides are a list of integers: the k-th stride
  * represents the jump in the memory necessary to go from one element to the next one in the k-th
  * dimension of the Tensor. This concept makes it possible to perform many tensor operations
  * efficiently.
